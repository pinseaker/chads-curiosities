# The Putter in the Tree

**Edition 2**

---

I once threw my putter into a pine tree. Back nine, Columbia Valley, back when I thought I was a good golfer.

As I climbed that tree—sap all over my hands, dignity somewhere on the fairway—it hit me: *What am I doing?* Not the climbing. I was clearly a dumb ass and had to retrieve my putter. But what kind of "good golfer" throws a putter into a tree?

It wasn't the putter's fault. It wasn't the tree's fault. It was the thing between my ears.

Golf has taught me something I didn't expect: you can't change the outcome after you hit the ball. You might not like where it lands. You might hate your next shot. But the ball is already there.

All you can do is walk to it and swing again.

Here's the thing about golf—whether you play or not, anyone can go for a walk. I just happen to stop along the way to swing a club.

Some of my favorite rounds have been with people who aren't even playing. No caddie energy. Just someone I've let into the sanctuary of a long walk with no pressure to perform.

---

After every swing, the outcome is fixed. What you do next is the only thing that matters.

I've been calling this The Mulligan Method. More on that later.

---

Golf has introduced me to some of the most amazing people I've met, and taken me to places on earth I never expected to see.

Turns out the game isn't about the score. It's about letting go.

Tap tap tap it in...
