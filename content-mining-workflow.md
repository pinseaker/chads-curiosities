# Content Mining Workflow
## Finding Ideas for Chad's Curiosities

---

## Step 1: Target Subreddits

Check these communities weekly. These are where younger Chad might be today:

| Subreddit | Members | What They Discuss |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| r/stopdrinking | ~950k | Sobriety journeys, struggles, victories, identity after alcohol |
| r/bartenders | ~100k | Industry grind, burnout, career transitions, war stories |
| r/hospitality | ~50k | Leadership, operations, the emotional toll of service |
| r/Entrepreneur | ~2M | Sink or swim moments, building without a roadmap |
| r/DecidingToBeBetter | ~600k | Self-improvement, habit change, becoming who you want to be |
| r/SoberCurious | ~50k | Questioning their relationship with alcohol |
| r/AskMenOver30 | ~300k | Mid-career pivots, identity, relationships, "what now?" |

## Step 2: Search Phrases

Go to each subreddit and search these exact phrases (keep the quotes):

**Pain-focused:**
- "I can't stand"
- "I'm struggling with"
- "Biggest struggle"
- "Hardest part"
- "I don't know how to"

**Help-seeking:**
- "How can I"
- "How do you"
- "Can someone help"
- "Help me"
- "Any advice"
- "Tips"
- "Suggestions"

**Reflection/Story:**
- "Finally realized"
- "I wish I knew"
- "Took me years"
- "Nobody tells you"

## Step 3: Filter Settings

- **Sort by:** Top
- **Time:** Past Month
- **Look for:** Posts with 50+ upvotes and 20+ comments (signals resonance)

## Step 4: Capture Template

When you find a good post, copy this info:

```
SUBREDDIT:
POST TITLE:
POST DESCRIPTION:
UPVOTES:
TOP 3-5 COMMENTS:




MY INITIAL REACTION:
```

## Step 5: Generate Content Ideas

Paste this prompt into Claude or ChatGPT along with your captured post:

---

You're a content strategist helping a curious generalist who writes about "things I didn't mean to think about."

The writer's lens:
- Hospitality background (bartender to bar owner)
- 20 years of drinking, now sober
- Believes in "Time Alchemy" — turning moments into meaning
- Philosophy: "Don't just do something—stand there"
- Audience: A younger version of himself who didn't know he needed help

Here's a real conversation from Reddit:

POST TITLE: [paste title]
POST DESCRIPTION: [paste description]
TOP COMMENTS:
[paste 3-5 comments]

Generate 10 content ideas from this:

1. 3 personal essay angles (connect to his journey)
2. 3 "reframe" pieces (show a different way to see the problem)
3. 2 practical takeaways (what he learned the hard way)
4. 2 questions to sit with (no answers, just curiosity)

For each idea give me:
- Headline (specific, not generic)
- Opening line (hook that pulls readers in)
- The Mulligan angle (what would "second shot first" wisdom say here?)

Make it feel human. No listicle garbage. No "Ultimate Guide" energy.

## Step 6: Weekly Rhythm

**Sunday (30 mins):**
- Scan 2-3 subreddits
- Capture 3-5 posts that spark something
- Run through the prompt
- Pick 1-2 ideas to develop

**During the week:**
- Let them marinate
- Write when it's ready

---

## Remember:

You're not writing for algorithms. You're writing for a younger version of yourself who was too busy grinding to know he needed this.

If it would've hit younger Chad, it'll hit someone else too.
