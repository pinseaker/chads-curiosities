# Things I Didn't Mean to Think About

**Edition 1**

---

Why now? Because I've been running into curious people, and I've been keeping the mosh pit in my brain to myself for too long.

I've had the good fortune to stumble, recover, and rebuild—often in public, sometimes gracefully, usually not. Along the way I've collected ideas, noticed patterns, and developed a way of seeing that I call "The Human Being Human" lens: toggling between acting consciously and reacting automatically.

I once declared Hospitality as "Time Alchemy"—the act of turning moments into meaning. The best way to achieve it? *Don't just do something—stand there.* It's Taoism smuggled into a punchline.

This newsletter is me doing the deep dive so you don't have to. Or maybe so we can do it together.

My why is to connect, share, and grow—so that I can help you do the same.

Welcome to Chad's Curiosities. Let's see what we didn't mean to think about.
