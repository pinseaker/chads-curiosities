# Pavlovian Karaoke

**Edition 4**

---

And it burns, burns, burns...

You finished that line in your head. You didn't choose to. Johnny did that to you decades ago, and it's still there, waiting.

That's not an earworm. That's Pavlovian karaoke.

---

But it's not just songs.

"How are you?"
→ "Good, you?"

"How'd you sleep?"
→ "Not bad."

"Can you believe this weather?"
→ *(something about weather)*

We don't think about these responses. We generate them. Someone drops a prompt into our human query box, and we autocomplete.

---

We're closer to an LLM than we'd like to admit.

---

But here's the thing:

There's a difference between *lazy* autocomplete and *intentional* incompleteness.

Lazy is "you know what I mean" — skipping the work, assuming connection.

Intentional is leaving space for someone to meet you halfway. Trusting them to finish the line. That's not dodging. That's invitation.

One avoids. The other connects.

I've been out from behind the bar for 20 years now. But once a bartender, always a bartender. It's not a job—it's a bias filter. A way of seeing.

And there's one phrase that still stops me cold:

"You know?"

No. I don't.

When someone says "you know," they're asking me to fill a gap they didn't bother to bridge. They're assuming I'm already there. But I'm not. I'm standing on my side, waiting for them to finish the thought.

"You know" isn't connection. It's outsourcing.

---

Pavlovian karaoke works when the song is shared.

But if you're the only one who knows the lyrics... you know :)
