# Blame It All on My Roots

**Edition 3**

---

I went down a rabbit hole the other day.

Asked the internet about my clan motto. McCormick. Figured there'd be some ancient phrase carved in stone, passed down through generations, untouchable.

There is. "Virtute et Labore." By virtue and labor.

But here's the thing—it doesn't mean just one thing. *Virtute* can mean virtue, courage, strength, excellence. *Labore* can mean work, effort, toil, persistence.

So which is it?

Yes.

I sat with this for a while. Turns out mottos aren't rigid. They evolve. Every generation interprets them through their own lens.

And then I had a thought that made me laugh out loud:

*Can I really be bold enough—egotistical enough—to redefine the motto of my entire lineage?*

I showed up in the family tree uninvited...

*(cue Garth Brooks)*

But here's what I landed on:

If history isn't fixed—if it's shaped by whoever's brave enough to engage with it—then the present is all that matters.

The past is a story we tell. The future is a story we'll never control. The present is where meaning gets made.

So maybe the motto isn't something I inherit.

Maybe it's something I get to shape.

---

Virtute et Labore.

By intention and action.

By who you're becoming and what you're doing about it.

I'm just a bartender. What do I know.
